Program Objective: Create a Game with an Arguement

The TITLE of my project is Painter

The TOPIC of my project is Paint-Throwing

My main point in my project is to show that throwing paint is not really
	all that fun.

If this project could change the world, it would teach people that proper
	painting with brushes and whatnot is much more rewarding than
	simply throwing paint--further justifying traditional art

I communicate my argument and story by the following elements through
	Processing: using Paint objects to splatter against walls.

Things that are not yet complete in my project: Also I want to try to allow colors to mix if they overlap.
	Also, I want to add in the ability to hold down shift for having a
	varying velocity depending on how long shift is held for.
