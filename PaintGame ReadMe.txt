Dear Future Startup,

Enclosed is a .zip archive of a game I've recently developed, titled Painter.  This project is based on Paint-throwing

and the main point of it is to show that throwing paint is not really all that fun. But it can be, with MUSIC!.

The project is about a robot who loves to throw paint at walls and ceilings and floors, so he was given a room to do that which he loved!

My career goal is to eventually become a game developer or tools developer for gaming companies

and this project highlights my experience in this field through the multi-class usage and animation aspects of the game.

I look forward to working with you and making a strong contribution to your team.

Sincerely,
Pavana Somisetty
